> This is going to be a two page app.

1. Page-1 is going to be details about me
2. Page-2 is where any user can send me a message - in order to send me a message they must create an account on my page and login to access the "send message" page
3. Also put a role of admin and user as well. So, any person who registered is a user by default
However, I can login using my id as admin - This allows me to see recieved message on website
Other people can only send message
